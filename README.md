## Why?

### Configurable

Malva is configurable. It provides several configuration options so you can
control the code style as you want.

Given the example below:

```css
button.disabled, button:disabled {}
```

This selector is short enough to be put on single line,
so Malva will put it on a single line by default,
instead of forcing it to be splitted into multiple lines.

However, if you prefer putting into multiple lines, you can configure it.

### Smart

Given the example below:

```css
button.disabled/*please use pseudo class as possible*/,button:disabled {}
```

There're comments inside selector. Some formatters will fail to format it, but Malva will format as:

```css
button.disabled /*please use pseudo class as possible*/, button:disabled {}
```

Also, thanks to the [Raffia](https://github.com/g-plane/raffia) parser,
Malva supports cutting edge CSS syntaxes like `@container`.

### Support (indented) Sass

Malva supports indentation-based Sass, not just SCSS.

## Quick Start

### Try It Online

If you just want a quick try, you can try with the [online playground](https://malva-play.vercel.app/).

### dprint

We've provided [dprint](https://dprint.dev/) integration.

Run the command below to add plugin:

```bash
dprint config add g-plane/malva
```

After adding the dprint plugin, update your `dprint.json` and add configuration:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "plugins": [
    "https://plugins.dprint.dev/g-plane/malva-v0.11.2.wasm"
  ],
  "malva": {
    // Malva config comes here
  }
}
```

You can also read [dprint CLI documentation](https://dprint.dev/cli/) for using dprint to format files.

## Configuration

Please refer to [Configuration](https://malva.netlify.app/config/index.html).

## FAQ

### I don't like some of code styles. Can I propose to change it?

Malva is not opinionated and is configurable,
and we accept different code styles then switch them with configuration.
But before proposing a code style change, it's better to open a new issue or discussion.

### My CSS code is in HTML, Vue, Svelte and Astro files. How can I format them?

If you're using dprint, you can use [markup_fmt](https://github.com/g-plane/markup_fmt)
which provides a dprint plugin, then you can use these two plugins together.
